|---|---|
| color | A hexadecimal string that describes a color. For example &quot;#000000&quot; is black, &quot;#FFFFFF&quot; is white. It has no importance in terms of operating the node, it is just a way to visually differentiate nodes. That color can be changed at any time by the node operator. |

# Lightspark Kotlin SDKs ðŸ¤–

This repository contains the Lightspark Kotlin (multiplatform) SDKs. It also contains a sample
Android app which uses the API to display basic node, channel, and transaction information.

## SDKs

### lightspark-server-sdk

An SDK for interacting with the Lightspark API from a server environment. This SDK is built on top
of the `lightspark-core` module and provides a simple wrapper around the Lightspark GraphQL server
API. It is meant to be used from a server environment which can authenticate using an Account API
token retrieved from your Lightspark account dashboard on the
[Api Config Page](https://app.lightspark.com/api-config). See `lightspark-server-sdk/README` for more
info.

### lightspark-wallet-sdk

An SDK for interacting with the Lightspark API for a single wallet user. It can be used from an
Android environment and is used by the sample app in this repository. See its README for more info.

### Building and running the sample app

You can build the SDK and sample app using Gradle or Android Studio. The easiest option is to open
this root directory as a project in Android studio and run the `androidwalletdemo` app configuration on an
Android device or emulator.

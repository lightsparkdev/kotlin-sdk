## Lightspark Kotlin SDK ðŸ¤–

This is a Kotlin (multiplatform) SDK for the Lightspark API. It is currently in development and not
ready for production use. It also contains a sample Android app which uses the API to display basic
node, channel, and transaction information. In the future, it will also be used to create a
full-featured Android wallet.

### Usage

> NOTE: The SDK is currently not published to any package repositories, but will be soon... Once it is, we'll add instructions for including the dependency in your project.

To use the SDK, you'll need to create a `LightsparkClient` instance. This is done via
the `LightsparkClient.Builder` class. The builder requires a `LightsparkConfig` instance, which
contains the base URL for the API, and the API token info. The token ID and token can be obtained
from the Lightspark Web App in your account settings.

```kotlin

// Initialize the client with account token info:
val lightsparkClient = LightsparkClient.Builder().apply {
    tokenId = "your-token-id"
    token = "your-secret-token"
}.build()

// An example API call fetching the dashboard info for the active account:
val dashboard = lightsparkClient.getDashboard()
```

### Building and running the sample app

You can build the SDK and sample app using Gradle or Android Studio. The easiest option is to open
this root directory as a project in Android studio and run the `androiddemo` app configuration on an
Android device or emulator.

### Updating the graphql schema

For now, you can update the graphql schema by running the `shared:updateGraphQLSchema` gradle task.
This will download the latest schema directly from the webdev git repo and replace the existing
schema.graphql file in the shared module. In the future, we should consider moving the schema to an
artifact registry where it can be versioned and tracked correctly.

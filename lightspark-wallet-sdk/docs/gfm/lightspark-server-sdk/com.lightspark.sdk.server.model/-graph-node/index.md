# GraphNode

[common]\
@Serializable

data class [GraphNode](index.md)(val id: String, val createdAt: Instant, val updatedAt: Instant, val bitcoinNetwork: [BitcoinNetwork](../-bitcoin-network/index.md), val displayName: String, val alias: String? = null, val color: String? = null, val conductivity: Int? = null, val publicKey: String? = null) : [Node](../-node/index.md), [Entity](../-entity/index.md)

This is a node on the Lightning Network, managed by a third party. The information about this node is public data that has been obtained by observing the Lightning Network.

#### Parameters

common

| | |
|---|---|
| id | The unique identifier of this entity across all Lightspark systems. Should be treated as an opaque string. |
| createdAt | The date and time when the entity was first created. |
| updatedAt | The date and time when the entity was last updated. |
| bitcoinNetwork | The Bitcoin Network this node is deployed in. |
| displayName | The name of this node in the network. It will be the most human-readable option possible, depending on the data available for this node. |
| alias | A name that identifies the node. It has no importance in terms of operating the node, it is just a way to identify and search for commercial services or popular nodes. This alias can be changed at any time by the node operator. |
| color | A hexadecimal string that describes a color. For example &quot;#000000&quot; is black, &quot;#FFFFFF&quot; is white. It has no importance in terms of operating the node, it is just a way to visually differentiate nodes. That color can be changed at any time by the node operator. |
| conductivity | A summary metric used to capture how well positioned a node is to send, receive, or route transactions efficiently. Maximizing a node's conductivity helps a nodeâ€™s transactions to be capital efficient. The value is an integer ranging between 0 and 10 (bounds included). |
| publicKey | The public key of this node. It acts as a unique identifier of this node in the Lightning Network. |

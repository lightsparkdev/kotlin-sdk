## Lightspark Kotlin Core

This is a Kotlin (multiplatform) module which is used internally by other Lightspark SDKs. It
contains shared utilities and helper classes which are used by the other SDKs. It usually won't be
necessary to include this module directly in your project, but it does offer some convenient
utilities if needed fr things like:

 - Parsing and formatting dates
 - Managing and creating signing keys
 - Working with auth and custom queries√è

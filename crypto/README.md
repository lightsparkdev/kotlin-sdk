# Module crypto

## Lightspark Kotlin Crypto

NOTE: This module is in early alpha and is not yet published.

This is a Kotlin (multiplatform) module which is used internally by other Lightspark SDKs. It is used for remote signing
logic when keys are kept only on a remote device off the node. It contains wrapped implementations for ecdh, secp256k1,
bip39, and bip32.

# Module crypto

## Lightspark Kotlin Crypto

NOTE: This module is in early alpha and is not yet published.

This is a Kotlin (multiplatform) module which is used internally by other Lightspark SDKs. It is used for remote signing
logic when keys are kept only on a remote device off the node. It contains wrapped implementations for ecdh, secp256k1,
bip39, and bip32.

See the [API Reference](https://app.lightspark.com/docs/reference/kotlin/crypto/index.html) for more
information.
